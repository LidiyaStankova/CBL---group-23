# ‚Ñπ Project Description
Burglary in London represents a critical public-safety challenge driven by socio-economic disparities and seasonal crime patterns. In this report, we present a data-driven framework that integrates a linear risk score with an XGBoost time-series model, leveraging deprivation and demographic data at the LSOA level to forecast monthly burglary risk. Results are interpretable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders by making use of the interactive dashboard. Forecasts are used to feed a constrained optimisation model that distributes police patrol hours among LSOAs and wards while following fairness standards, personnel limitations, and shift constraints. The findings show that by efficiently focusing on high-risk regions and guaranteeing fair distribution, the strategy can improve resource allocation.

> This repository ingests UK burglary data, Census 2021, Index of Deprivation (IoD) 2019, and other external data.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Processing
Burglary dataset `burglary-cleaned.csv` and other datasets that are cleaned and processed can be found in directory `explainability` in the `.zip` folder when you download the main directly from GitHub repository link provided.
The original datasets can be cleaned and processed by studying the steps in `../explainability/explainable.ipynb` (adjust the datasets and directory paths at your convenience and purpose). Then, datasets can be correctly joined without data leakage.

# üé¨ Setting Up
## Environment
> **Note:** The `../config/environment.yml` files assume the environments has conda installed specifying `python=3.11.11+`, which uses conda chaneels. 
They are not directly compatiable with pip-only setups. 
- `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- `conda activate py311`

> Pip-only Setup
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `.gitignore` (files to be excluded from version control)


# üï≥Ô∏è Project Structure
## OLS Linear Regression (LSAO Level Risk)
Run `python lso_risk_regr.py`.
The risk score for each LSOA in London is computed and full regression summary is printed.
- `../model/lso_risk_regr.py`
### üîß Model Pipeline
1. `combined_dataset.csv` (not included in the `.zip` file)
2. Deprivation indicators (IoD) `File_6_-_IoD2019_Population_Denominators.xlsx`: income, education, health, crime, and living environment deciles
3. Poverty `poverty_2013_update.xls`: 2006 vs. 2010
4. Census 2021: `Household composition.xlsx`, `Age on arrival in UK.xlsx`, and `Economic Activity.xlsx`
5. Linear risk score is predicted after fitting an OLS regression of burglary rates per 1,000 residents 

> Recommended to rerun quarterly if new IMD or housing data is available.

## XGBoost Model + Optuna Time-Series Forecast (Ward Level)
Run `python plm.py`.
This model ingests historical burglary counts and static ‚Äúrisk scores". It builds lagged time-series features, tunes an XGBoost regressor with Optuna, and produces out-of-sample forecasts and demand-scores for downstream allocation.
- `../model/plm.py`
The model forecasts residential burglaries in next 12 months.

### üîß Model Pipeline
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - **Filter** `combined_dataset.csv` to burglary from Jan 2022 onward
   - Geographical data of LSOA-ward mapping are loaded.
   - **Aggregate** to monthly counts per ward  
   - **Merge** in `lsoa_risk_scores.csv` to compute mean, std, min, and max
   - **Feature Engineering** temporal features (year, month, quarter, seasons, cyclical encodings) through RFECV
   - **Create** lagged features (1, 2, 3, 6, 12), rolling stats. EWMA, trend, volatility, and interaction with risk
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning** Optuna (minimising RMSE over 5 trials)
   - **Drop** any rows with missing lags or risk scores  
2. **Train/Test Split**  
   - Trained the XGBRegressor on selected features (RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$ are reported on both splits)
3. **12-month Forecasts**
   - Monthly recursive forecasting per ward is saved
   - Outputs `ward_burglary_predictions_12months.csv`

Justification and assumptions of the model can be found in the report. Similarly for hyper parameter tuning, final model fit, and prediction are explained to subsequently evaluate the metrics.

> Suggested to retrain the model monthly as soon as prior month's crime figures are available.

## Police Resource Allocation Model
Running `python Patrol_Allocation_Model.py` will produce `../data/allocation_halfyear.csv` which can be ingested into the dashboard.

1. **Load inputs**  
   - `ward_burglary_predictions_12months.csv`
      - pandas DataFrame with `Month`, `Ward`, `Predicted_Burglaries`.  
   - `ward_lsoa_with_area.csv`
      - merges ward - LSOA and area (km¬≤).
2. **Set monthly bounds** 
   - Maximise $\sum_{i}{r_i \alpha_i (1 + X_i)}
   - Total ward has a budget cap of 3,200 h
   - Minimum 1 h per day per LSOA
   ```python
      days = tm.days_in_month
      base_max = 2.6 * days
      base_min = 1.0 * days
      (hours per LSOA)
3. **Output**
   - Allocations are rounded up to the nearest 0.25 h into a combined `csv` file

Detailed computation of area-scaled caps, weights, and optimisation can be found in the report. 
It uses the latest 12 month forecast and produces patrol-hour allocations for next 6 months per ward and LSOA.

## Statistical Model
The `Statistical_Model.py` script fits a straightforward (log‚Äìlinear) OLS model to estimate a static burglary‚Äêrisk score for each LSOA, based on socio-environmental predictors. Running the script will produce `../log_burglary_risk_scores_v2.csv`.

- `../model/Statistical_Model_1.ipynb`
- `../model/Statistical_Model_2.ipynb`

- `../model/log_burglarly_risk_scores_v2.csv`: 
   - Log risk score: model prediction in log-rate
   - Exp risk score: back-transformed "burglaries per 1,000" score


# Report
Key transformations (OLS, XGBoost features, and Allocation), feature engineering, performance diagnostics, and hyperparamter ranges through Optuna are all elaborated in the report, therefore, this README.md will only contain the setup providing data collection guide, processing pipeline, and how-to-use instructions of the models.

# Assumptions and Constraints
1. OLS (`lso_risk_regre.py`)
   - Linearity and additive effects
   - No multicollinearity
   - Independe of residuals
2. XGBoost (`plm.py`)
   - Stationary over training
   - No major policy changes
3. Allocation (`Patrol_Allocation_Model.py`)
   - Diminishing returns captured by $ln(1 + X)$
   - Exchangable patrol hours within a ward
   - Min/max bounds ensure safety and duo-patrol operations

# Downstream Integraion of Outputs
- Statistical model's `log_burglary_risk_scores_v2.csv` file is ingested into `1_insights.py` in `dashboard_cleaned` directory.
- Resulted `ward_burglary_predictions_12months.csv` file of XGBoost model is ingested into `Overview.py` in `dashboard_cleaned` directory.
